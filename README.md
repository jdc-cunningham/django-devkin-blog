# django-devkin-blog
A lite-weight blog based on Django but designed to be displayed with a side-by-side thought-process pad "developer nakpin" 
hence devkin terrible name

## The plan

The plan is, for me personally, I like to write my thoughts into a notepad as I develop/work on something. 
I want to show this on the blog in line with the progress of the actual blog content. In wide screen it's side by side.
Mobile it would be a tab you click on (if you want to see it).

## Why?

I don't know... that's where the magic happens, the thought process.

## Other features

One thing I wanted to build was a photo-compressor that creates automatic copies. 
I know re-inventing the wheel but it's an interesting challenge.
