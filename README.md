# django-devkin-blog
A lite-weight blog based on Django but designed to be displayed with a side-by-side thought-process pad "developer nakpin" 
hence devkin terrible name

### The plan

The plan is, for me personally, I like to write my thoughts into a notepad as I develop/work on something. 
I want to show this on the blog in line with the progress of the actual blog content. In wide screen it's side by side.
Mobile it would be a tab you click on (if you want to see it).

### Why?

I don't know... that's where the magic happens, the thought process.

###  Other features

One thing I wanted to build was a photo-compressor that creates automatic copies. 
I know re-inventing the wheel but it's an interesting challenge.

### Concept

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdc-cunningham/django-devkin-blog/master/devkin/devkin-concept.png "DevKin Concept")

Conceptually it's just like a text pad, see photo below. Except the editable "pads" are unique/in a group and are auto-incrementing by time and updating. (self-time stamping). The point is to show the progression of time to work on a project from start to finish.

So It's pretty much like, you write the blog by filling this "developer napkin" in as you work. The "polished" blog determines the parent container of the DevKin side panel which will have scroll if it's longer than the blog section (probably the case) will be more apparent when I get a bare setup going. I've got some content to blog about (projects in progress). However the Django blog part, I'm still working on, following through a tutorial. This DevKin thing I can write as it's just HTML/CSS/JS then it will have an endpoint upload (probably to itself(server) but a Django endpont).
